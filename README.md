Windows.UI.Interactivity
========================

Windows.UI.Interactivity is a port of System.Windows.Interactivity to the Windows Runtime for Windows 8.

In Windows 8.1 a Behaviors SDK will be added. This library will still be here for Windows 8 development, but for WIndows 8.1 development I recommend using the Behaviors SDK which will be available when Windows 8.1 goes RTM.
